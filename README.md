### FEDEVEL Directory Structure
This project contains directory structure which we use at FEDEVEL for projects.

### How to use it
Each directory and subdirectory has a readme.txt file with detailed explanation about what files should be placed there.

To start using this structure, simply press "Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP". Unpack the zip and place the main directories on your server(s).

### What to consider
You may want to place "Design Files" & "Released Files" directory on your server which is regularly backed up. "Project Files" are not required to be backed up (if something happen, you can usually re-download all the document).
