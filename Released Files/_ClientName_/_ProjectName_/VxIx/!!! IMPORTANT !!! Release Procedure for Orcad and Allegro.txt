Follow this procedure before releasing files. Confirm every action with your initials and date.
IF ANY CHANGES NEEDS TO BE DONE, START THE PROCEDURE FROM BEGINNING!

The procedure needs to be executed in order as defined here. Start from number 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Before you start the releasing procedure, be sure that off-page intersheet references are updated:
Go to OrCAD, select project, go to Tools-> Annotate, Update entire design, Add Intersheet References, press OK


1) Run Schematic DRC
In OrCAD, select project, then Tools -> Design Rules check. Be sure, that following is selected and checked:
Design Rules Options: Check entire design, Check Design rules, Run Electrical Rules, Run Physical Rules
Electrical Rules settings: All checked, except "Check SDT cmpatibility", "Run Custom DRC", "Report all net names", "Report hierarchical ports and off page connectors"
Physical Rules settings: All checked, except "Check device with zero pins", "Check power ground short", "Run Custom DRC"

I confirm, that I have reviewed Design Rules Check log output and it is ok:

2) Generate netlist
In OrCAD, select project, then Tools -> Create netlist

I confirm, that I have reviewed Create Netlist log output and it is ok: 
YourInitials [DAY-MONTH-YEAR]

3) Import netlist into PCB
In Allegro, go to Import -> Netlist, press Import Cadence. Then go back to Import->Netlist and press Viewlog button.

I confirm, that I have reviewed Netlist import log output and it is ok:

4) Impedance
I confirm, I have updated and checked track width/gap to match required impedance (e.g 55 OHMs):

5) Update silkscreen
In Allegro, go to Manufacture -> Silkscreen. Be sure, that following is set:
Layer: Both; Elements: Both; 
Silk: Board geometry, Package geometry, Reference designator; Set others to None;
Checked: All Rotation, Detailed text checking, clear solder mask pad; Set others to Uncheck
Set 0.1mm for: Displacement increment, Minimum line length, Element to pad clearance
Maximum displacement: 15mm (can be incresed if needed)

I confirm, that I have reviewed Autosilk TOP and Autosilk BOTTOM layers and they are ok:

6) Generate Assembly Drawing layers for variants
Select ASM TOP color file view build from: BrdGeo & PkgGeo & RefDes / Assembly_Top; BrdGeo/Design_Outline. Open Export -> Variants -> Create Assembly Drawing.
Select Top Side & Use Assembly Data. Run this for every Variant in the design.
Select ASM BOTTOM color file view build from: BrdGeo & PkgGeo & RefDes / Assembly_Bottom; BrdGeo/Design_Outline. Open Export -> Variants -> Create Assembly Drawing.
Select Bottom Side & Use Assembly Data. Run this for every Variant in the design.
Now run "add_layer_name" script. Be sure correct Variant layers are selected in the TOP and BOTTOM lists. Then check the Assembly Drawing layers.

I confirm, that I have reviewed Assembly Top & Bottom layers for every variant and they are all ok:

7) Run DRC Check
Go to: Constraint Manager -> Analyze -> Analysis mode and be sure ALL RULES in all categories are "ON".
Go to: Check -> Check design status, press Update DRC. Be sure all DRCs are green. Waived DRC errors do not have to be green, but be sure you check them!

I confirm, that everything in the DRC status panel is green. If Waived DRCs are not green, I confirm, that I have checked them one-by-one:

8) Gerber check
I confirm, that I have copied and visually checked gerber files placed in "\Step 1 - PCB Manufacturing\Gerber Output\"
YourInitials [DAY-MONTH-YEAR]

9) Other files
I confirm, that I have copied and checked files placed in other subdirectories:
